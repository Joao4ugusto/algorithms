## Variables and Data Types

int: integer values.
float: single-precision floating-point values.
double: double-precision floating-point values.
char: single characters.

## Control Structures
C++ provides control structures for conditional execution and iteration, such as if, else, while, for, and switch statements.

~~~
If-Else Statement
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
