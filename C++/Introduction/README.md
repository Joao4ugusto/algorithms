## Including Libraries
~~~c++
#include <iostream>
~~~

## Main Function
~~~c++
int main(){
  // Your code goes here
  return 0;
}
~~~

## Variables and Data Types
C++ has several basic data types for representing integer, floating-point, and character values:
~~~~c++
int: integer values.
float: single-precision floating-point values.
double: double-precision floating-point values.
char: single characters.
~~~

## Control Structures
>C++ provides control structures for conditional execution and iteration, such as if, else, while, >for, and switch statements.

### If-Else Statement
~~~~c++
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
~~~

### While Loop
~~~~c++
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
~~~

### For Loop
~~~~c++
for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
~~~

### Switch Statement
~~~~c++
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
      // Code to execute if variable == value1
      break;
    case value2:
      // Code to execute if variable == value2
      break;
      // More cases...
    default:
      // Code to execute if variable does not match any case value
}
